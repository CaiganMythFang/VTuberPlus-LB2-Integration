VTuberPlus Integration Extension for LioranBoard 2
by Caigan and Erdenshire
version 1
----------

--INSTALL--
In LioranBoard 2 main menu, click the Transmitter button on the left side, and click Install Extension. Select the [vtuberplusintegration-v1.lb2] file.

--USAGE--
This extension connects to the VTuberPlus Websocket, and adds a command to LioranBoard 2 so you can send commands to VTuberPlus and activate the various items and effects.

The LioranBoard 2 command is called "VTPMessage", and has a drop down to select from the list of commands (as of version 2.6 of VTuberPlus). You can type in custom commands in case new ones are added as well.

--NOTES--
* VTP_FX: commands are toggles, so to turn them off send the command again.
